TODO List
--------
  - Calculate Hessian exactly for NN
  - Get HFO to work better.

  - More data loaders (JSON/binary/etc.)
  - More model persistence methods (ARFF/JSON/etc.)
  - Optimizations to GD/SGD
    + Momentum
    + Regularization
  - More Trainers
    + Particle Swarm
    + Conjugate Gradient
    + Newton's method? 
      - 1D: x_n+1 = x_n - f'(x_n)/f''(x_n)
      - ND: x_n+1 = x_n - (H(f)(x_n)^-1)*grad(f(x_n))
        + Invert Hessian Dataset
	+ Multiply by gradient
	  - Perhaps dampen the result a bit
	+ x_n - alpha*(f'(x_n)/f''(x_n))
	+ alpha in [0, 1]
    + Kalman Filter / EKF / UKF
  - Models
    + Convolutional model
    + Recurrent Model
  - Error Functions
    + Cross-entropy error
      - Softmax layer
